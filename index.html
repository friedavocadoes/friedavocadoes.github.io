        The northeastern wilderness of Japan is a vast area encompassing six rural prefectures that are linked by custom, heritage, and recent tragedy. 
        The devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Tohoku in 2011 revealed the resilient nature of its people, and local passion and pride are 
        helping the region get back on its feet. There's a lot to be proud of: dramatic landscapes, historically significant sites, craft sake, and a variety 
        of outdoor activities like rafting, hiking, and skiing. Tohoku, which is much more rural than Tokyo but more developed than Hokkaido, makes for 
        exciting excursions from the capital and memorable side trips on the journey to Japan's main island's northernmost region.

      <p class="content-basic">Bali , Island (pop: 4,309,600), Indonesia. Located in the Lesser Sunda Islands, off the eastern coast of Java, 
        it constitutes, with minor adjacent islands, a province of Indonesia. The main towns are Singaraja and Denpasar, the provincial capital. The island is
         mountainous; its highest peak is Mount Agung (10,308 ft [3,142 m]). Colonized by India in early times and supplemented by émigrés from Java in the 16th 
         century, Bali is the remaining stronghold of Hinduism in the Indonesian archipelago. Visited by the Dutch in the late 16th century, it came under Dutch 
         rule only in the late 19th century. It was occupied by the Japanese in World War II and became part of Indonesia in 1950.</p>
